# NotRouge
A very simplified "RPG" that started out as a rougelike but its totally not now
It's a rpg with no R barely any P and just kind of a G

persistant leveling, when you die half gold, most items, half your levels go poof.
Random Enemies and Items that you can edit the Items and the Enemies text files to add your own or edit and mess around with.
No real exploration
No locations besides a shop and a dungoen
can run in the terminal or a nifty graphical user interface
really just something to play around with... nothing special.
